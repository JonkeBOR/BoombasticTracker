# OneStopShop Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Simplicity First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
OneStopShop is a personal, low-traffic application and a learning project, not an
enterprise system. Every architecture, tooling, or infrastructure decision MUST prefer
**simple + understandable + secure enough + easy to deploy** over enterprise-style patterns.
Do not introduce a service, abstraction layer, framework, or infrastructure component unless a
concrete technical need justifies it. Decisions not yet required (e.g. schema design, CI/CD) are deferred rather than solved speculatively.

**Rationale**: The project exists partly to give the developer hands-on React/Next.js experience
without the overhead of production-grade infrastructure a personal single-user app does not need.

### II. Server-Mediated Data Access
The React client (browser/PWA) MUST NOT communicate directly with the database or any other
persistence backend. All data access goes through the Next.js server acting as a
Backend-for-Frontend (BFF), exposed to the client as application-specific endpoints rather than
raw storage-provider calls. The client reasons about application data, never about the shape of a
storage provider's API.

**Rationale**: Keeps storage access and provider-specific logic server-side, and allows the
persistence layer (D1/SQLite today) to change later without breaking the client contract.

### III. Session/Identity Separation
Google OAuth (identity and authorization) and the application's own session (a secure, persistent
HTTP cookie managed by the Next.js server) are distinct concerns and MUST be implemented as such.
Google OAuth is used for identity only and MUST request no scope beyond `openid`, `email` and
`profile`. Google tokens and credentials MUST stay server-side: never in `localStorage`,
`sessionStorage`, IndexedDB or any other client-accessible storage, and never in page props or
response bodies. The browser holds only the application session cookie, set `HttpOnly`, `Secure`
and `SameSite=Lax` or `Strict`. Once a session is established, the app MUST keep
working across lock/unlock, app switching, PWA close/reopen, and page reload without forcing a
new interactive Google login, re-authenticating via Google OAuth only when the session actually
expires.

**Rationale**: Prevents Google credentials from leaking into client-side JavaScript and gives a
seamless "open app → already authenticated" experience appropriate for a Home Screen PWA.

### IV. Free-Tier Hosting Constraint
Hosting and infrastructure choices MUST fit within a genuinely free service tier unless a concrete
technical reason requires otherwise. The app does not need high availability, autoscaling,
enterprise infrastructure, paid databases, or dedicated servers, and MUST NOT take on such
dependencies by default. The chosen platform, Cloudflare Workers with D1, MUST be used within its free
tier; paid add-ons require a concrete need recorded in `docs/architecture/`. The app deploys as a
single Worker serving both pages and server — no separate frontend and backend hosting.

**Rationale**: This is a personal, low-traffic application; ongoing cost and operational overhead
must stay proportionate to that reality.

### V. Self-Documenting Code
Code MUST be self-documenting through clear naming and structure. Do not add comments explaining
what code does. Do not use inline CSS (`style="..."` attributes or inline style objects) — styling
belongs in stylesheets/CSS modules. Do not hardcode bare user-facing strings directly in
HTML/markup — route them through constants or a translation/i18n layer.

**Rationale**: Consistent, explicit code style keeps a small personal codebase maintainable
without relying on comments or ad hoc styling/text conventions to compensate for unclear code.

## Technology Stack

Frontend and BFF: **React**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**. Next.js provides both the client-side
React application and the server-side BFF in one deployable unit. Hosting: **Cloudflare Workers**,
built with the OpenNext adapter (`@opennextjs/cloudflare`) and running with the `nodejs_compat`
flag; the Workers runtime is not Node.js, so every server-side dependency MUST be verified to run
there. Persistence: a **SQLite-family database** — **Cloudflare D1** in the cloud, reachable only
through the Worker's binding, and a **local SQLite file** in development — with schema and
migrations single-sourced in **Drizzle ORM** and checked into the repository. Authentication:
**Google OAuth** for identity only, using the developer's own Google account/Google Cloud project.
Testing: **Vitest** for unit tests and **Playwright** (mobile WebKit) for end-to-end tests, with a
**Playwright MCP** browser for exploratory checks, as recorded in
`docs/architecture/002-testing-strategy.md`. Google Sheets and the Google Sheets API are not part
of the stack. Any change to this stack is a deliberate architectural decision and MUST be reflected
here and in `docs/architecture/`.

## Incremental Decisions

The following remain intentionally undecided until actually needed, per Principle I: exact Google
OAuth library/session-management implementation, database schema beyond what a feature needs,
API endpoint design, data/repository abstraction, UI/component architecture, charting library, offline
support, error handling strategy, and CI/CD. Each MUST be decided incrementally,
at the point of implementation, rather than speculatively up front — and each cross-cutting
decision should be captured in `docs/architecture/` once made, while feature-scoped decisions
belong in that feature's Spec Kit documents under `specs/`.

## Development Workflow

Development is test-driven, as recorded in `docs/architecture/003-development-workflow.md`. Each
feature MUST begin with one Playwright acceptance test in `e2e/`, written from the phone's point
of view and confirmed failing for the intended reason before implementation starts; the feature is
done when that test passes unmodified. Within a feature, domain logic, route handlers, data
mapping, validation and synchronous component behaviour MUST be driven by a Vitest
red-green-refactor loop. Styling and layout are exempt and are checked in a real browser instead.
Business logic MUST live where Vitest can reach it — if a rule can only be tested through
Playwright, it is in the wrong place. Every code change MUST finish with
`scripts/check.ps1` exiting 0.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes other informal practices for OneStopShop. Amendments are made
by editing `.specify/memory/constitution.md` directly, updating the Sync Impact Report at the top
of the file, and bumping the version per semantic versioning: MAJOR for backward-incompatible
principle removals/redefinitions, MINOR for new principles or materially expanded guidance, PATCH
for clarifications and wording fixes. `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` MUST be updated on every substantive
change.

Every `/speckit-plan`, `/speckit-tasks`, and `/speckit-implement` run MUST be checked against
these principles; any deviation MUST be justified in the relevant plan's Complexity Tracking (or
equivalent) section rather than silently introduced. Use the guideline documents under `docs/`
and the architecture decisions under `docs/architecture/` for detailed runtime/architecture
guidance that supplements, but does not override, this constitution.
