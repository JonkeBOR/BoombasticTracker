# Running BoombasticTracker

The app runs through npm. The PowerShell scripts in `scripts/` are the quality gate, not a
launcher - they never build or serve the app.

## Development

    npm run dev

`next dev` with Turbopack on http://localhost:3000. Leave it running; Turbopack hot-reloads edits,
so an edit does not need a restart.

## Production build

    npm run build
    npm run start

`next build` also type-checks with the local `tsc`. Run it before concluding that a change is
deployable - it catches Server/Client boundary errors that `next dev` tolerates.

## LAN exposure for iPhone testing

    npm run dev -- -H 0.0.0.0

Open the phone's Safari at `http://<lan-ip>:3000`. The dev server prints the address as `Network:`
on startup - it was `http://192.168.0.46:3000` on this machine, but a DHCP lease can move it, so
trust the printed value over this one.

Expect a Next.js cross-origin dev warning on first load. The fix is `allowedDevOrigins` in
`next.config.ts` - hostname only, no scheme and no port:

    const nextConfig: NextConfig = { allowedDevOrigins: ['192.168.0.46'] };

## What the LAN check does and does not prove

It proves layout, safe-area insets and icons on the real device.

It does **not** prove standalone launch. Safari's manifest handling on an insecure origin is not
something Apple documents, so the chrome-less Home Screen launch is only properly provable from an
HTTPS origin. Deploy before concluding the PWA works.

## Relationship to the browser tooling

The Playwright MCP browser and `scripts/e2e.ps1` both drive http://localhost:3000. `e2e.ps1` starts
a dev server if none is running and reuses yours if one is; the MCP never starts one. See the
`test` skill.
